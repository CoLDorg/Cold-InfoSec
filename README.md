# Cold-InfoSec

This is a list of InfoSec resources and tools intended for cybersecurity professional and educational use.

## List of Resources
1. [Awesome Hacking](https://github.com/carpedm20/awesome-hacking) - This repo is inspired from the awesome-* trend on GitHub. It mainly has tools used for Hacking purposes. Not a good place for beginners.

2. [Onlurking's Awesome InfoSec](https://github.com/onlurking/awesome-infosec) - A curated list of awesome information security resources, inspired by the awesome-* trend on GitHub. It has lots of tutorials listed and most of them are very detailed. Suitable for veterans and rookies alike. If you have an idea of what you want to learn then this is the perfect place for you.

3. [The Art of Hacking](https://github.com/The-Art-of-Hacking/h4cker) - This GitHub repository has been created to provide supplemental material to several books, video courses, and live training created by Omar Santos and other co-authors. It provides over 7,000 references, scripts, tools, code, and other resources that help offensive and defensive security professionals learn and develop new skills. The all-about-it reference. It has resources related to everything. However there's no particular path outlined. See this only if you know what you need and have enough patience to find it.

4. [Roppers Academy](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/) - "This is the only site on the internet that walks a complete beginner all the way through the process of developing a strong foundation in the fundamentals.". The perfect place to begin at. If you want to start out in this field or if you are a beginner, then beign with their introductory course. 
(This was such a good site that I have mentioned it separately even after it has been listed in the above mentioned repositories.)
